GOALS FOR TODAY:

3: getting inputs from inputs in react.

4: Go through login page example

====================


Reminder: Always remember that you're in your react application's folder that contains package.json when you go 
to run any npm commands. 

1: Create a new react project:

npx create-react-app appname --use-npm --typescript

2: If you don't have the node_modules folder filled  (You will NOT have a node_modules folder if you just clone this repo! Heads up!)

npm install 

3: Install semantic ui react

a. Run this command to install with npm.

```npm install semantic-ui-react```

b. Put this line at the top of your index.html file

```<link rel="stylesheet" href="//cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/semantic-ui@2.4.2/dist/semantic.min.css" />```


4: To begin running your react application

```npm start```

5: To end the application instance running

Go to your terminal running the application, the same one you ran ```npm start``` in and then hit ```ctrl + c``` keys on your
keyboard at the same time. That is not a command you "write into the terminal". You simply select that particular terminal and
then press that key combination ```ctrl + c```. This will end the process running in that terminal.
